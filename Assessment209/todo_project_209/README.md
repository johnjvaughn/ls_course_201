# LS 209 Assessment
## Todo project

Notes:
1. The checkboxes in the given samples look a little different than the default checkboxes in my browser.  I assumed I did not need to customize them, but can do that if it was intended.

2. I assumed a steady 100px right margin on the main page (rather than a percentage margin), since it was 100px in the samples.

3. I could not find a way to make the default "placeholder" values in the modal form's date selects appear gray on loading while keeping the other text in those menus black.  I may need a hint if this issue needs to be corrected.
