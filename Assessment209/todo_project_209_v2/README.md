Notes/Assumptions:

1. Concerning the modal form box: The problem states it should be placed "proportionally" over the main area; however in my mind that does not exclude the possibility over over-hanging the main area, as long as it is placed proportionally.  And, at narrower screen sizes when the nav is checked on, the modal might hardly appear on screen at all if completely contained in the main area.  So I left the modal at a constant 570px by 400px.  This means at very narrow screen sizes below 570 it will not fit within the screen. However, the problem did not state a specific requirement for screens that small; only for "narrower screens 768px and below".
