Notes/Assumptions:

1. I noticed the hover styles (cursor and color) for "Item 1" were lost, due to overlaying a label element there to handle the toggle-on of the modal.  I believe I have that corrected.
There was always a label for "Item 1" but I overlayed the other element ("modal_switch") to handle the modal toggle, because at the time I couldn't find another way to do it while keeping the modal form outside of the ul list.  Now I found another way, though I did lose the ability to click anywhere on the screen to close the modal.

2. On the date dropdown menus -- yes, I am using Windows. I got your screenshot but I can't see the problem at all.  The "select" selector has always had the same padding (8px 10px) as the input and textarea elements.  When I remove that padding, it looks like the screenshot you sent.
